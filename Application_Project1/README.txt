The purpose of this driver project was to create a timer.

Pressing button 1 will increase the minutes
Pressing button 2 will increase the seconds
Pressing button 3 for more than 3 seconds will clear the timer
Pressing button 3 for less than 3 seconds will start the timer
Once the timer reaches 0, an alarm message will be displayed
